This project aims at providing a visualization tool for scrapped EHR at ICHC FMUSP

1 upload a CSV with a rghc column (id) and a full_text column (during dev, this was the concatenation of Haematology Consultations scrapped from Tazi EHR, however, the goal is to adapt to any EHR)
text must be lowercased and accents removed

2 perform a search based on regex

3 visualize results
